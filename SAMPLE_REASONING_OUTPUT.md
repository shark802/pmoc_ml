## Scenario 1: High Risk with Conflict Detection
**Situation:** High Risk classification despite 90% alignment and 8% conflict (ML model prediction based on demographics)

```
🔴 HIGH RISK CLASSIFICATION:
   • Requires immediate, intensive counseling intervention

📊 DECISION SOURCE: Hybrid Analysis (Methods Disagree)
   • Response-Based Calculation: Low Risk
     → Disagreement ratio: 8.0%
     → Alignment: 90%, Conflict: 8%
   • ML Model Prediction: High Risk
     → Based on demographic patterns and learned relationships
   • Final Decision: High Risk
     → Chosen: ML model prediction (demographic factors indicate risk)

👥 DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS:
   • ⚠️ Significant age gap: 15 years (Male: 45, Female: 30)
     → Large age gaps can indicate different life stages and values
     → This demographic factor may contribute to relationship challenges
   • ⚠️ Previous relationship experience: Divorced
     → May affect current relationship dynamics and require healing focus
     → This factor may contribute to relationship challenges
   • ⚠️ Education-Income Mismatch: 3 level difference
     → Education level: 5, Income level: 2
     → Significant differences may indicate compatibility challenges
     → This demographic factor may contribute to relationship stress
   • ⚠️ Employment Status: Unemployed
     → Unemployment may contribute to financial stress and relationship challenges

💬 RESPONSE-BASED FACTORS:
   ⚠️ CONFLICT DETECTED: High Risk classification despite positive response indicators
   • ✅ High Alignment: 90% agreement between partners
   • ✅ Low Conflict: 8% disagreement rate
   • Response-based calculation suggests: Low Risk
   • ML Model Prediction: High Risk (based on demographic patterns)
   • Explanation: Despite good alignment and low conflict, demographic factors
     (age gap, civil status, education-income mismatch, employment) indicate
     potential relationship challenges that may not be immediately apparent
     in current responses but could surface over time.

📋 MEAI CATEGORY ANALYSIS:
   • ✅ Communication: 85% alignment (High - strong agreement)
   • ✅ Conflict Resolution: 88% alignment (High - strong agreement)
   • ✅ Financial Management: 92% alignment (High - strong agreement)
   • ✅ Intimacy & Affection: 87% alignment (High - strong agreement)

📝 SUMMARY:
   The High Risk classification is based on:
   • ⚠️ ML Model Prediction (demographic-based) overrides response-based calculation
   • Despite good alignment (90%) and low conflict (8%),
     demographic factors indicate potential relationship challenges
   • Response-based calculation: Low Risk (8.0% disagreement)
   • Primary factors: Demographic patterns (age gap, civil status, education-income mismatch)
```

## Scenario 2: Low Risk (Normal - No Conflict)
**Situation:** Low Risk with high alignment and low conflict (both methods agree)

```
🟢 LOW RISK CLASSIFICATION:
   • Response Analysis: 10.0% weighted disagreement ratio (threshold: ≤15%)
   • This indicates healthy relationship with minimal disagreements
   • Preventive counseling recommended to maintain relationship health

📊 DECISION SOURCE: Both Methods Agree
   • Response-Based Calculation: Low Risk
   • ML Model Prediction: Low Risk
   • Final Decision: Low Risk (consensus)

👥 DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS:
   • ✅ Minimal age gap: 3 years (similar life stages)
   • ✅ Single status: No previous relationship complications
   • ✅ Compatible education-income levels: Similar socioeconomic status
   • ✅ Employment Status: Employed (stable income)

💬 RESPONSE-BASED FACTORS:
   • ✅ High Alignment: 85% agreement between partners
     → Partners share similar values and perspectives
     → This strong alignment supports Low Risk classification
   • ✅ Low Conflict: 10% disagreement rate
     → Minimal disagreements, healthy communication patterns
     → This low conflict supports Low Risk classification

📋 MEAI CATEGORY ANALYSIS:
   • ✅ Communication: 82% alignment (High - strong agreement)
   • ✅ Conflict Resolution: 88% alignment (High - strong agreement)
   • ✅ Financial Management: 80% alignment (High - strong agreement)
   • ✅ Intimacy & Affection: 85% alignment (High - strong agreement)

📝 SUMMARY:
   The Low Risk classification is based on:
   • Low disagreement ratio: 10.0% (threshold: ≤15%)
   • High alignment and low conflict patterns
   • Healthy relationship indicators despite any demographic factors
```

## Scenario 3: High Risk (Normal - No Conflict)
**Situation:** High Risk with low alignment and high conflict (both methods agree)

```
🔴 HIGH RISK CLASSIFICATION:
   • Response Analysis: 42.0% weighted disagreement ratio (threshold: >35%)
   • This indicates significant disagreements across multiple MEAI categories
   • Requires immediate, intensive counseling intervention

📊 DECISION SOURCE: Both Methods Agree
   • Response-Based Calculation: High Risk
   • ML Model Prediction: High Risk
   • Final Decision: High Risk (consensus)

👥 DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS:
   • Moderate age gap: 7 years (Male: 35, Female: 28)
   • ⚠️ Previous relationship experience: Separated
     → May affect current relationship dynamics and require healing focus
     → This factor may contribute to relationship challenges
   • ⚠️ Education-Income Mismatch: 2 level difference
     → Education level: 4, Income level: 2
     → Significant differences may indicate compatibility challenges
     → This demographic factor may contribute to relationship stress
   • ✅ Employment Status: Employed (stable income)

💬 RESPONSE-BASED FACTORS:
   • ⚠️ Low Alignment: 35% agreement between partners
     → Significant differences in values and perspectives
     → This low alignment contributes to High Risk classification
   • ⚠️ High Conflict: 42% disagreement rate
     → Frequent disagreements between partners
     → This high conflict rate is a primary factor for High Risk

📋 MEAI CATEGORY ANALYSIS:
   • ⚠️ Communication: 30% alignment (Low - needs attention)
   • ⚠️ Conflict Resolution: 25% alignment (Low - needs attention)
   • ⚠️ Financial Management: 40% alignment (Low - needs attention)
   • ⚠️ Intimacy & Affection: 35% alignment (Low - needs attention)

📝 SUMMARY:
   The High Risk classification is based on:
   • High disagreement ratio: 42.0% (threshold: >35%)
   • ML model pattern recognition indicating significant relationship challenges
   • Demographic factors (age gap, civil status, education-income mismatch) may contribute
   • Low alignment and/or high conflict patterns detected

## Scenario 4: Medium Risk (Normal)
**Situation:** Medium Risk with moderate indicators

```
🟡 MEDIUM RISK CLASSIFICATION:
   • Response Analysis: 25.0% weighted disagreement ratio (threshold: 15-35%)
   • This indicates moderate concerns requiring proactive attention
   • Proactive counseling recommended to address identified issues

📊 DECISION SOURCE: Both Methods Agree
   • Response-Based Calculation: Medium Risk
   • ML Model Prediction: Medium Risk
   • Final Decision: Medium Risk (consensus)

👥 DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS:
   • Moderate age gap: 6 years (Male: 32, Female: 26)
   • Long-term cohabitation: 6 years
     → Established relationship patterns, may have unresolved issues
   • Moderate education-income difference: 1 levels
   • ✅ Employment Status: Self-employed (variable income)

**Situation:** Low Risk classification despite low alignment and high conflict (ML model suggests stability)

```
🟢 LOW RISK CLASSIFICATION:
   • Preventive counseling recommended to maintain relationship health

📊 DECISION SOURCE: Hybrid Analysis (Methods Disagree)
   • Response-Based Calculation: High Risk
     → Disagreement ratio: 45.0%
     → Alignment: 30%, Conflict: 45%
   • ML Model Prediction: Low Risk
     → Based on demographic patterns and learned relationships

   • ⚠️ Low Alignment: 30% agreement between partners
   • ⚠️ High Conflict: 45% disagreement rate
   • Response-based calculation suggests: High Risk
   • ML Model Prediction: Low Risk (based on demographic patterns)
   • Explanation: Despite current disagreements, demographic factors suggest
     potential for relationship stability. However, current response patterns
     indicate immediate attention may be needed.

📋 MEAI CATEGORY ANALYSIS:
   • ⚠️ Communication: 25% alignment (Low - needs attention)
   • ⚠️ Conflict Resolution: 20% alignment (Low - needs attention)
   • ⚠️ Financial Management: 35% alignment (Low - needs attention)

   • Despite concerning demographic factors, current relationship indicators
     (alignment: 30%, conflict: 45%) show healthy patterns
   • Note: Monitor relationship as demographic factors may still pose challenges
